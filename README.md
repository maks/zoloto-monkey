# zmonkey

## What is it?
A mad science experiment to help me learn about modern JS engine performance
optimisations (tracing etc) from the best opens source engines today: Moz's
ion/odin-monkeys and V8 by implementing various parts in JS.
Also inspired by [this blog
post](http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/06/03/explaining-js-vms-in-js-inline-caches.html)
 from mraleph (aka Vyacheslav Egorov).

## the name?

Mozilla calls its JS engines something-monkey. 
золото ('zoloto') is the word for gold in Russian.  

There was also a 80s adventure tv show 
called ['tales of the golden monkey'](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Gold_Monkey)
 that I fondly remember watching.
