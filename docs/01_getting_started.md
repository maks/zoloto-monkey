# Episode 1 - Getting Started

## First steps

So as mentioned in the top-level readme, [this blog
post](http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/06/03/explaining-js-vms-in-js-inline-caches.html)
 from mraleph (aka Vyacheslav Egorov) is a big part of the inspiration for
 this, so reading it through several times is a good start. Though I should
 also mention that I have been interested in languages that implement
 themselves for a while, c-compiler compiling itself, JVMs written in Java,
 etc.
